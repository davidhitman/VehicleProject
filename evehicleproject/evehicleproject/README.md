# EVehicle Renting System

## Introduction
This project is done for the Programming and System Development course for 2023-24 year.
Our team consists of 4 people: Dhananjay, Dayu, David, and Divyanshu. Like on every other renting system, you can use this to rent a vehicle from the given category and get access to the list of all the nearby stations from where you can pick up your rented vehicle. This project is mainly built on Tkinter with PostgreSQL as the database manager. The data is taken from an external API of NextBike ad integrated with our own data for dynamic tables.
